dilution_solver

Code which helps with the preparation of solution samples *en masse*.

If you don't have any sample concentrations prepared, but you know the
concentration range for each compound that you would like to explore, then the
Design of Experiments in the `doe` module can help with the creation of a set
of sample concentrations.

If you have a collection of sample concentrations to prepare, and you need to
decide on which stock solutions to prepare, and how much to use for each
sample, use the code in the `routines` module.
